# Covid-19 Genetic Epidemiology Analyses

In this repository we report our analyses of publicly available genomic sequences of Human h-Cov19. All the data used here is provided by the laboratories that kindly shared information through GISAID. We cannot share the input datafile, however please refer to Data pre-processing to generate the fasta file: aligned_fftnsi.fasta 


1. Data pre-processing. [Preprocess](https://github.com/JuliaPalacios/Covid19_Analyses/blob/master/alignment/alignment.md). Alignment file is called aligned_fftnsi.fasta and deposited in your local data folder.





2. Estimates of Mutation rate




3. Population Structure





4. Diversity (Effective population size)
